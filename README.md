# DoA-from-EEG
Attempting to implement the ideas from the paper "Depth of anaesthesia assessment based on adult
electroencephalograph beta frequency band" by Dr. Tianning Li and Dr Peng Wen (found here: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13246-016-0459-5) using a publicly available dataset (found here: https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/EEG_and_BIS_raw_data/5589841). 

I have tried to limit my use of libraries as much as possible in order to cement my understanding of the employed concepts.
